# Madden Discord Bot (8/2025)
The goal of this bot is to help commissioners in Madden Franchise mode. Connected franchises have 32 users (for each team), and managing people that are constantly leaving and joining teams is very difficult. This bot streamlines the process by keeping track of the avaiable teams and presenting a convienient and flexible interface displaying the avaiable teams.
